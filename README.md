Capturing the Milky Way using mobile phone and using OpenCV to bring out the Milky Way stars is the aspiration of this project.

Steps on mobile phone:
1. Please use App like [Star Walk 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitotechnology.StarWalk2Free&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1) to locate the position of the Milk Way
2. Do have a stable mobile phone tripod as it takes 10 to 15 secs to take one starry sky photo
3. Please use the Pro mode of your mobile phone where you can set the ISO to range of 50-80 and speed to 10 to 15 secs
4. Use voice or Bluetooth clicker activation to trigger camera capture as the mobile need to be very still during the photo capturing

Te journey to capture the Milky Way is still in progress as my city night sky is highly light polluted.

This code has 2 parts:
* Part 2: Batch to Improve Low Lighting Photos
* Part 1: Understanding Codes using Learn OpenCV Tutorial
